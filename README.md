# bills_repository

This repository has the files for Project 1.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints in my schedule I was unable to do 100% of the assignment.  The last step I completed
was installing the playbook for ELK-VM.

Ansible files for jumpbox are in /Ansible/jumpbox-vm folder

Ansible files for elk are in /Ansible/elk-vm folder

I did not do a diagram, however I included some screenshots from my Azure environment showing the virtual objects I did create and configure

The Linux Commands.txt file in the /Linux folder show the commands I used to get as far as creating and installing the playbook for ELK-VM
